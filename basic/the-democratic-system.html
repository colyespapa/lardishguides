            System</h2>
    </div>
    <article>
        <h3>From Monarchy to Representative Government</h3>
        <img style="width: 300px;" class="image-left" src="images/10/repressed.jpg"
            alt="A photo depicting the royal control during the monarchy.">
        <p>In the formative, often paradoxical, early years of the <strong>Lardish Republic</strong>, the nation
            continued its operation
            largely under the pervasive influence of a monarchical system. Though officially designated a republic in
            <strong>2020</strong>, a significant contradiction existed: no democratic elections were actually held
            during this initial
            period. The Parliament, structured with both a lower and a higher chamber, regrettably functioned far more
            as a pliable instrument of royal control than as a genuine forum for civic representation. Its members were
            meticulously appointed by the President, but only after a careful selection process conducted by the King
            himself and his inner circle of trusted advisors. In this system, unwavering loyalty to the Crown remained
            the solitary, overriding qualification for holding any legislative office, underscoring the centralized
            nature of power. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>A Nation Awakens: The First Steps Toward Democracy</h3>
         <img style="width: 300px;" class="image-right" src="images/10/approval.jpg"
            alt="A photo showing the approval of the republican reforms.">
        <p>A palpable shift in the national mood began to emerge. In <strong>March 2022</strong>, spurred by escalating
            popular unrest
            and persistent pressure from determined reformist factions, the <strong>Lardish National Electoral Institute
                (LNEI)</strong>
            was formally founded under the guidance of the <strong>Central Lardish Committee</strong>. This marked a
            pivotal moment. The
            LNEI's inaugural public consultation, held in April, became the country’s very first formal act of
            widespread citizen participation, a symbolic initial step away from autocracy.

            This nascent democratic process culminated in a crucial <strong>major referendum held in October
                2022</strong>, wherein
            citizens were presented with several critical questions that directly challenged the existing order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Should the country remain a constitutional monarchy?"</li>
            <li>"Should general elections be held every four years?"</li>
            <li>"Should electoral reforms begin immediately?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The public's response was definitive and overwhelming: they voted decisively for change. This powerful
            collective endorsement undeniably paved the way for what would soon be recognized as the transformative
            <strong>Republican Transition</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>Founding the Republic and a New Legislature</h3>
        <img style="width: 300px;" class="image-left" src="images/10/new-congress.jpg"
            alt="A photo showing the new reformed congress of the USFLR.">
        <p>Bolstered by a confluence of both popular and burgeoning institutional support, <strong>Lard
                Lapudding</strong> proclaimed the
            official establishment of the Republic in <strong>December 2022</strong>. His declaration was accompanied by
            a solemn and
            highly anticipated promise: to hold free and fair elections in the upcoming <strong>May 2023</strong>. These
            elections were
            slated to determine the nation's new leadership, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The President</li>
            <li>The Vice President</li>
            <li>Members of the Regional House of Lardish Representatives (REHAR)</li>
            <li>The House of Lardish Deputies</li>
            <li>The Lardish Senate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This newly conceived tricameral system was meticulously designed to ensure a robust and comprehensive balance
            among regional, national, and federal interests, aiming for a more equitable and representative form of
            governance. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>REHAR was designated to represent the distinct states and their local regions.</li>
            <li>The House of Deputies was established to give voice to the general populace across the nation.</li>
            <li>The Senate was intended to function as the upper, federal chamber, providing a broader, more national
                perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>War and Postponement: Democracy Delayed</h3>
        <img style="width: 250px;" class="image-right" src="images/10/elections-cancellation.jpg"
            alt="A photo depicting the cancellation of the May 2023 elections due to the Three Lardish War.">
        <p>However, the path to a fully realized democracy proved unexpectedly arduous. Before these pivotal elections
            could even take place, the nascent nation was tragically plunged into the devastating <strong>Three Lardish
                War</strong>, a
            conflict that forced an unavoidable postponement of the highly anticipated vote. A fragile semblance of
            stability only gradually returned by <strong>November 2023</strong>, at which point the very first national
            elections in the
            <strong>United States of the First Lardish Republic (USFLR)</strong> could finally be held, albeit under the
            shadow of recent
            conflict.
            <br>
            To secure a victory in these critical elections, candidates were constitutionally mandated to garner at
            least <strong>55% of the vote</strong>. Lard Lapudding successfully won the presidency with an impressive
            <strong>75% of the vote</strong>,
            cementing his leadership. However, his chosen Prime Minister candidate fell short of the required
            threshold, necessitating a runoff election. This subsequent contest ultimately resulted in <strong>Juanita
                Banana's</strong>
            victory with <strong>59%</strong> of the vote. Both leaders were inaugurated immediately following their
            respective wins,
            while the newly constituted Congress officially took office in <strong>January 2024</strong>, marking the
            full transition to
            the elected government.
        </p>
        <h3>An Idea Never Realized</h3>
        <img style="width: 250px;" class="image-left" src="images/10/united-congress.jpg"
            alt="A photo depicting the new reformed congress of the USFLR, with the three chambers visible.">
        <p>In the final, tumultuous months leading up to the country’s eventual dissolution, President Lapudding's
            administration harbored one last significant electoral ambition: they proposed implementing an <strong>electoral
            college system</strong>, explicitly drawing inspiration from the model utilized by the United States. This proposed
            reform aimed to further refine the nation's democratic mechanisms. However, the plan encountered widespread
            and staunch opposition from various factions across the Republic. Consequently, this ambitious idea, despite
            its potential to reshape the political landscape, was never fully enacted, remaining a mere theoretical
            footnote in the nation's brief democratic experiment.</p><br>
