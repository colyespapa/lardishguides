            <h3>The Birth of Congress and a New Era</h3>
            <img src="images/6/2022-referendum.jpg" alt="First Referendum held in the USFLR, marking the beginning of
                democracy in the Lardish Republic"
                class="image-left" width="200px">
            <p>When the Lardish Republic officially came into being in <strong>2020</strong>, its foundational
                structure, as decreed by
                one of its primary architects, <strong>Tutita Col</strong>, was that of a monarchy. For the initial two
                years of the
                <strong>USFLR</strong>'s existence, no elections whatsoever were held. Instead, the King personally
                appointed all
                parliamentary representatives, a stark contradiction to the constitutional stipulation that members of
                the lower chamber were explicitly meant to be chosen directly by the Lardish people. Yet, even amidst
                this autocratic beginning, the spirit of democracy was quietly stirring. As early as
                <strong>2021</strong>, during his
                tenure as CEO of <strong>Lard Corporation</strong>, <strong>Lard Lapudding</strong> had already begun
                laying the groundwork for a
                comprehensive electoral system. These preparations culminated in <strong>2022</strong> with the formal
                establishment of
                the <strong>Lardish National Electoral Institute</strong>, which was officially inaugurated in
                <strong>March 2022</strong> by the <strong>Central
                    Lardish Committee</strong>.
            </p>
            <img src="images/6/lnei-logo.png" alt="Logo of the Lardish National Electoral Institute" class="image-right"
                width="200px" style="border: 1px solid black;">
                
            <p>The newly formed Electoral Institute's inaugural, and critically important, function was to meticulously
                organize, oversee, and publish the results of a groundbreaking <strong>referendum held in April
                    2022</strong>. This event
                marked a monumental leap for democratic participation in the fledgling nation, representing the very
                first instance where citizens were directly empowered to participate in significant national decisions.
                The referendum comprised nine distinct questions, but two, in particular, stood out for their immediate
                impact and symbolic weight:
            <ul>
                <li><q><strong>Do you consider it necessary to preserve the 'President of the USFLR'
                            position?</strong></q></li>
                <li><q><strong>Do you consider it necessary to preserve the 'King of the USFLR' position?</strong></q>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <img src="images/6/citizen-voting.jpg" alt="Citizen voting in the first referendum of the USFLR"
                class="image-left" width="200px">
            <p>This referendum directly challenged the King's established leadership and the very structure of the
                early government. Yet, in a fascinating demonstration of their initial preferences, the Lardish people
                ultimately opted to preserve both positions, signaling a desire for stability, or perhaps, a gradual
                transition rather than an abrupt break from tradition.</p>
            
            <p>The democratic currents continued to churn, leading to yet another significant referendum in
                <strong>October
                    2022</strong>. This time, voters were asked to weigh in on whether they wished for the USFLR to
                become a
                constitutional monarchy and if it was considered essential to hold general elections every four years.
                Both propositions were met with overwhelming public approval, seemingly cementing a path toward a more
                defined, regular democratic process.
                However, <strong>Lard Lapudding</strong>, ever the strategic visionary, perceived a critical flaw in
                this outcome. He
                swiftly launched a powerful new movement: <q><strong>Republic for the Elections</strong></q>,
                encapsulating its core message
                in the compelling motto: <q><strong>If you want elections, we need a republic.</strong></q> This slogan
                cleverly implied that
                truly fair and consistent elections could only be achieved through the establishment of a full
                presidential republic, subtly undermining the authority of the constitutional monarchy voters had just
                endorsed. This persuasive argument resonated deeply with the populace. By <strong>November 15,
                    2022</strong>,
                the collective sentiment was undeniable; all chambers of Parliament, including the influential
                <strong>Central
                    Lardish Committee</strong>, had publicly expressed their unequivocal desire to transform the country
                into a
                presidential republic.
            </p>
            <img src="images/6/cld-congress.jpg" alt="Establishment of Congress in the Central Lardish District"
                class="image-right" width="250px">
            <p>Responding to this powerful mandate, on <strong>December 01, 2022</strong>, <strong>Lard
                    Lapudding</strong>, with the crucial backing of
                the Parliament, the Vice President, and the Prime Minister, officially adopted the <strong>presidential
                    republic</strong>
                system for the nation. This momentous shift brought about significant structural changes: the former
                Parliament was formally rechristened as <strong>Congress</strong>, and its lower chamber underwent a
                further division,
                creating two distinct legislative bodies with specialized roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Regional House of Lardish Representatives (REHAR)</strong>: This new body was
                    specifically designed to
                    oversee issues impacting local regions and individual states, bringing governance closer to the
                    people
                    at a grassroots level.</li>
                <li><strong>The House of Lardish Deputies</strong>: Tasked with approving bills originating from the
                    REHAR and forwarding
                    them to the Senate, this chamber also held the power to propose new legislation concerning specific
                    states or the country as a whole directly to the Senate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Concurrently, the former higher chamber evolved into the <strong>Lardish Senate</strong>, now primarily
                responsible for
                deliberating on bills submitted by the House of Deputies, engaging in discussions with the President and
                its own members, and possessing the authority to directly propose new legislation. Once a bill received
                joint approval from both the Senate and the President, it would officially be put into action, marking a
                clear and powerful legislative process.</p>
            <img src="images/6/postponed-elections.jpg" alt="Postponed elections in the USFLR due to the Three Lardish War"
                class="image-left" width="200px">
            <p>With the new Congress and the presidential republic system firmly established, <strong>Lard Lapudding</strong> made a
                clear and unequivocal promise: general elections would be held the very next year, in <strong>2023</strong>, to
                democratically elect the President, Vice President, and all members of Congress. These eagerly
                anticipated elections were initially scheduled for <strong>May</strong>. However, the unfolding crisis of the <strong>Three
                Lardish War</strong> cast a long shadow over these plans, compelling a necessary postponement. The vital
                democratic exercise was ultimately pushed back and held in <strong>November 2023</strong>. The profound impact of this
                conflict, and the detailed outcomes of these pivotal elections, will be explored more thoroughly in the
                subsequent chapters of this historical account.</p>
