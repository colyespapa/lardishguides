            <h3>The Official Languages of the Lardish Republic</h3>
            <img src="images/5/listofwords.png" alt="The last list of words of Lardish released" class="image-left"
                width="250px">
            <p>As formally stipulated within <strong>Article 38</strong> of its Political Constitution, the
                <strong>United States of the First
                    Lardish Republic (USFLR)</strong> recognized a rather unique linguistic duality: <strong>English and
                    Lardish</strong> were both
                enshrined as official languages. Yet, the story behind Lardish, in particular, is one of ambition,
                innovation, and persistent struggle. Prior to the Republic's very establishment, its visionary creator,
                <strong>Tutita Col</strong>, harbored a grand aspiration: to forge an entirely new language for his
                people. This dream
                led to the founding of <strong>Lard Corporation</strong>, a pivotal entity whose broader impact we will
                explore in
                greater depth within the advanced course material.
                The formal development of the Lardish language officially commenced in <strong>2019</strong>, though its
                genesis can be
                traced back to an initial prototype crafted in mid-<strong>2018</strong>. The early stages, however,
                were not without
                their internal challenges. Following a period of corporate upheaval, <strong>Lard Lapudding</strong>
                briefly assumed the
                helm as CEO after Tutita Col's temporary resignation. Despite this leadership shift, the King's shadow
                loomed large, as he remarkably retained significant, if indirect, influence over the ongoing linguistic
                project. By <strong>2021</strong>, Tutita Col had re-assumed the role of CEO, a move that, perhaps
                ironically, led to a
                noticeable slowdown in the language's development, hinting at shifting priorities or internal friction.

                target="_blank" title="Click to read the article on the
                Lard News website">
                <img src="images/5/proposal-remove-Lardish.jpg" alt="Image of the result of the proposal to remove Lardish as an
                official language in the House of Deputies." class="image-right" width="250px"></a>
            <p>Even before the Republic's formal establishment, a crucial <strong>referendum</strong> was conducted in
                <strong>April 2022</strong>, putting the
                very future of Lardish into the hands of its nascent citizenry. The question was clear: did the people
                deem it necessary to preserve Lardish as an official language? The verdict was resounding: the public
                overwhelmingly elected to retain it, a powerful testament to its perceived cultural importance. This
                developmental momentum, however, faced an unforeseen hurdle in <strong>2022</strong> with the official
                establishment of
                the Republic itself—a pivotal event that will be the central focus of our next historical chapter.
                By the time this burgeoning linguistic endeavor halted, the fruits of Lard Corporation's labor,
                encapsulated in the <strong>New Lardish Dictionary compiled in 2021</strong>, amounted to a mere
                <strong>73 words</strong>. A stark
                reversal of fortunes then occurred with the Republic's formal inauguration: <strong>Lard
                    Lapudding</strong>, assuming a
                more prominent executive role, declared <strong>English as the main official national language</strong>.
                Curiously, and
                perhaps controversially, a formal constitutional amendment to solidify this shift was never actually
                enacted, leaving the legal status of Lardish in a peculiar limbo.

            <p>The linguistic saga continued into <strong>2023</strong> when Lard Corporation introduced <strong>Lardish
                    Guides</strong>, a program
                seemingly aimed at revitalizing interest. Yet, this initiative, too, met an untimely end following the
                <strong>dissolution of the Institute of the Lardish Language</strong> after a significant bill was
                passed by the Senate.
                At this juncture, a palpable sense of uncertainty pervaded the Lardish populace concerning the future of
                their fledgling language. Widespread speculation mounted that the President himself intended to present
                a direct bill to the <strong>Supreme Constitutional Court</strong>, seeking to definitively expunge
                Lardish from its
                official status.
                This proposed legislative action, however, immediately encountered fervent opposition from within the
                Senate. Crucially, it was subsequently denied by the Supreme Constitutional Court, notably without the
                concurrence of all its chambers. This decisive intervention was largely spearheaded by the
                <strong>Lardish
                    opposition judges</strong>, who saw their duty as safeguarding 'national culture' against what they
                perceived as
                an existential threat to the language.
            </p>
            <p>Despite this setback, the issue of Lardish's official standing was far from settled. In <strong>2024</strong>, the
                contentious bill was proposed once more. This time, in a truly unprecedented display of political
                alignment, a consensus was remarkably reached within both the <strong>House of Deputies and the Senate</strong>. The
                renewed bill, a comprehensive legislative package addressing various facets of national identity, was
                widely anticipated to receive the President's approval, and subsequently, the Supreme Constitutional
                Court's final endorsement.
                Yet, fate intervened. Due to the sudden and impactful <strong>resignation of Lard Lapudding</strong> and the concurrent,
                momentous announcement of the entire country's dissolution, this crucial bill ultimately failed to pass
                into law. Consequently, in the annals of Lardish history, one clear conclusion emerges: <strong>Lardish</strong>, despite
                its turbulent journey and the many attempts to sideline it, <strong>always technically served as an official
                national language</strong> of the USFLR until the very moment the nation itself ceased to exist. Its story stands
                as a testament to the complex interplay of culture, power, and political will within a vanished
                republic.</p>
